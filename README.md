## Project Overview


## Business Understanding (Problem/Stakeholder)

Obesity is a significant public health concern in the United States and globally that contributes to adverse effects on an individual's health and places a great economic burden on healthcare systems. Addressing obesity requires a comprehensive understanding of its determinants and what various lifestyle factors and influencers seem to contribute to its prevalence. 

With obesity being significant issue that can have problematic implications, a team of public health professionals is seeking to understand what various factors contribute to obesity and could predict the development of obesity diagnosis. By understanding the various lifestyle, diet and demographic factors that lead to obesity, they can develop plans and interventions to both reduce obesity rates and improve overall health. 

To help determine the best areas of focus, this project aims to investigate the various diet, demographic and lifestyle factors that contribute to obesity rates within the US population by exploring the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset. I plan to use exploratory data analysis to understand the data and help determine what factors best contribute to obesity. From there, predictive modeling will be incorporated to develop a model to predict or classify obesity based on the data and the features uncovered. 

The findings from this analysis will be able to help inform and guide public health strategies, interventions, and policies aimed at reducing obesity rates and promoting healthier lifestyles. 



## Data Understanding (make sure to add link to dataset)

The primary dataset for this project is from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset, available on Kaggle and also found on the CDC's website. The BRFSS is done annually via telephone surveys, and provides comprehensive data that is collected from U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, their use of preventive services, and other various diet and lifestyle factors. The dataset includes variables such as demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity), physical activity levels, health indicators (obesity status), and other various factors. 

This dataset from the 2022 BRFSS contains 445132 entries and have 326 columns representing the multiple features. For this analysis, I plan to use a subset of the columns representing a variety of features that could be linked with obesity or may be interesting to explore in relation to the target variable.
